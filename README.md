# ContainerJS
An experiment with the objective of bringing rational objects using a solid abstraction to provide methods and attributes that follow a fixed pattern and increase the readability and coherence of the code.

## How it works?
ContainerJS is a library that implements a new JavaScript constructor, **Container**, among its functionalities its main use is to isolate an object in a solid abstraction, allowing safe and coherent operations to be performed with it and keeping it in its initial type, which prevents unwanted behaviors.
